This is my professional web development portfolio that was developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The work featured in my portfolio includes some of the group projects I worked on over the last 6 months in the Northwestern Full Stack Web Development Coding bootcamp as well as a couple side-projects that I've been tinkering with.
